# Finance-Calculator
A finance calculator for simple interest, compound interest, and annuites.

This program prompts the user to select from either simple interest, compound interest, or annuities.
It then prompts the user for relevant data and displays the desired values.

This is my first programming project. Constructive criticism is appreciated.
